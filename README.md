# Flutter Firebase Performance

Firebase Performance Monitoring is a service that helps you to gain insight into the performance characteristics of your Apple, Android, and web apps.
You use the Performance Monitoring SDK to collect performance data from your app, then review and analyze that data in the Firebase console. Performance Monitoring helps you to understand in real time where the performance of your app can be improved so that you can use that information to fix performance issues.
